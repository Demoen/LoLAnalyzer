# Using machine learning to evaluate the best pick in a draft (League of Legends)

Under construction

## How to use

You need a developer API-KEY from https://developer.riotgames.com/. If your API-KEY has expired at some point, just update the config.ini file.
You need also Python 3 and Tensorflow.

1. ConfigUpdater.py : generate your personnal config.ini file. It is a simple text file and easy to edit.
2. DataDownloader.py : download raw game files according to the parameters in config.ini (patches, regions, leagues).
3. DataExtractor.py : pre-process all the downloaded data (all patch, all regions).
4. Learner.py: train a neural network on all the downloaded data.
5. BestPick.py: under construction

## Miscellaneous
- When there's a new patch, run ConfigUpdater.py
- You can delete config.ini to start with a clean config but it's easier to simply edit the file
- You can download games from several patches by listing them in the config.ini file. See the list of all the patches for the synthax and existing patches. In order to download the most recent games first the patches should be ordered from the most recent to the oldest. 
- When you download games, you may experience some errors (see https://developer.riotgames.com/response-codes.html), most often: 503 if the service is unavailable, 403 means your API-KEY has expired (edit config.ini with a new one from https://developer.riotgames.com/). 
- The downloaded games are located under DATABASE_ROOT/patches/PATCH/REGION/. You can change the patch/regions you're downloading games from by simply editing config.ini. 
- Pre-processed data location is DATABASE_ROOT/ (data.cvs and extracted.txt) and contains all the data you've downloaded (all patches/all regions)
- Only data.cvs is used for the training, so if you need to free some space on your hard drive you can delete the data files from a patch you've already fully extracted (under DATABASE_ROOT/patches/).
- The models you train are located under DATABASE_ROOT/model.
